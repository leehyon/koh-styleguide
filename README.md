# Koh Style Guide

Welcome to my personal style guide. This guide outlines the conventions and guidelines I follow for various aspects of my projects, including file naming, documentation, and more. Consistency in coding and project organization not only improves readability but also enhances collaboration.

## Table of Contents

- [Directory Naming Conventions](directory-naming-conventions.md)
- [Chinese Documentation Style Guide](documentation-style-guide-zh.md)

Remember that a personal style guide is flexible and can be adapted as your preferences evolve. It's a tool to help you communicate more effectively and consistently. Keep it concise and easy to reference so that you're more likely to use it regularly.
